Overall, we feel that all members contributed fairly. We called many times throughout to discuss our approach to the project. Hunter took initiative for many parts of the program, Alyssa contributed new code and worked to get a minimum viable product working for each step, and Max thoroughly debugged.

The following is a brief timeline of the project:
Hunter created a skeleton for the code.
Hunter created untested code for the key-value-store-view endpoint
Alyssa created untested code for a third endpoint
Hunter started on causal broadcast implementation
Hunter started a vector clock functionality
Alyssa started to debug using Docker to establish a minimum viable product
Everyone fixed errors
Hunter added functionality for when replicas start up
Max thoroughly debugged until everything was working well
